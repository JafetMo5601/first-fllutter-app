# first_flutter_app

## Description
This is a new Flutter project initializate meanwhile I am starting a Flutter learning path.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application development path. Below you can find a couple of resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project, or just as a help in case that you already have experience:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## Getting Started

You can check the respective documentations about how to install the dependencies and be able to run the application in a simulated device or just using the personal mobile device.

- [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Install Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [[Video] How to setup Flutter on Android Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfz_AraTk_k)

## Help
This repository will be deprecated at some time in the future, but if you have any idea to implement to this 'sample app' go ahead an open a Pull Request and I will check it out! :D
